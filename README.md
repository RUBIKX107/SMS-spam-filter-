# SMS-spam-filter-

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam using **PyTorch**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**. It serves as a practical introduction to natural language processing and neural networks.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing using **pandas**.
- Text transformation from strings to numerical representations.
- Neural network model trained with **PyTorch** over 20 epochs.
- Classification of messages into spam (1) and non-spam (0).
